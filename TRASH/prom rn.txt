heyyy, so basically i have created a react js website that is a weather forecasting website, so , the website is connected to an API  (visual crossing api) in order to predict weather and to display certain currennt conditions such as heat index, weather, wind speed etc, so basically i wanted to integrate machine learning in it in order to predict future humidity, a si was told before i worte code and created a model (linear regression) and i trained and tested that model an dalso used POSTMAN in order to send requests, and it worked properly and also i had integrated to display it in the frontend of my websit, however i lter found out that i had made a grave mistake that the frontend and also the rest wud display a single predicted value while as due to my weather forecasting website, i have to display the predicted humidity for various cities and states, what do i do next
