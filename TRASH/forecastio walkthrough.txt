🚀 How AI/ML Can Complement Your Existing API
Custom Regional Predictions:

Train your model specifically on local historical weather data (e.g., Mumbai).
The AI model can fine-tune forecasts for your region, which might not be fully optimized in the general API.
Pattern Recognition for Anomalies:

AI can detect unusual weather patterns or anomalies that a general API might miss.
Short-Term Forecast Refinements:

Use the API's forecast as an input to your AI model for fine-tuning.
For example: "The API says 70% chance of rain, but based on local patterns, AI predicts 85%."
Predictive Analytics Beyond API Scope:

Predict weather trends like seasonal changes, heatwaves, or monsoon onset using long-term historical data.
AI-Based Weather Insights:

Provide insights like “Similar weather conditions occurred in July 2018, which led to heavy rainfall.”
Data Imputation:

If the API has missing or delayed data, your AI model can generate approximate predictions based on trends.
🛠️ Architecture Overview
Input Data:

API (Real-time data from Visual Crossing)
Historical Weather Data (CSV files)
AI/ML Model Pipeline:

Preprocess data (clean & normalize historical data).
Train your ML model (e.g., LSTM for time series predictions).
API data can serve as live inputs to your ML model.
Backend Integration:

Host the AI model (e.g., using Flask/FastAPI).
Build endpoints like /ai-weather-predict.
Frontend (React.js):

Display the API forecast and AI-enhanced predictions side-by-side.
Show comparison charts: “API vs AI Prediction.”
🔑 Key Takeaway:
Instead of replacing the API, use your AI/ML model to enhance, validate, and customize the forecasts provided by the API.
