------------------------Breakdown of the Code-------------------------------------------------------------------------

python

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

This line imports the matplotlib.pyplot library, which is a widely used library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
This line creates a new figure for plotting with a specified size of 10 inches wide and 5 inches tall.
python
plt.scatter(y_test, predictions, alpha=0.7)
This line creates a scatter plot where:
y_test represents the actual humidity values.
predictions represents the predicted humidity values from your model.
alpha=0.7 sets the transparency level of the points, making overlapping points more visible.
python
plt.plot([y_test.min(), y_test.max()], [y_test.min(), y_test.max()], 'r--')
This line adds a reference line to the plot that represents perfect predictions. The line runs from the minimum actual value to the maximum actual value:
If your predictions were perfect, all points would lie on this line.
The 'r--' specifies that the line should be red and dashed.
python
plt.title('Actual vs Predicted Values')
This sets the title of the plot to "Actual vs Predicted Values".
python
plt.xlabel('Actual Humidity')
This labels the x-axis as "Actual Humidity".
python
plt.ylabel('Predicted Humidity')
This labels the y-axis as "Predicted Humidity".
python
plt.show()
Finally, this command displays the plot.
Interpretation of the Plot
Points Close to the Line: If most points are close to the dashed red line, it indicates that your model is making accurate predictions.
Points Far from the Line: Points that are far from this line suggest larger prediction errors.
Conclusion
This visualization is an effective way to evaluate your model's performance qualitatively. If you run this code after training your model, you'll gain valuable insights into how well your model is performing in predicting humidity values.
